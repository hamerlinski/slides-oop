# How to pass?

# Object Oriented Programming
## How to pass?

* Exercises during classes and work in the classroom + tests/quiz.
* Project.
* Extra points for open source contribution.

Lessons typically will start with topic introduction. Then students will perform small and simple tasks which will be reviewed and graded before end of class. After teacher's approval, students must commit their solution.

$$
\begin{array}{c}

\mathbb{X} = 0.5 \times\mathbb{E} + 0.5 \times\mathbb{P} \\
\tt where\,\, \mathbb{E}\,\, means\,\, average\,\, from\,\, excercies,\\
\tt and\,\, \mathbb{P}\,\, means\,\, grade\,\, from\,\, the\,\, project

\end{array}
$$

<br>

**Each of the components of the grade must be positive.**

# Object Oriented Programming
## How to pass? - Project
Project must obey all rules presented up to (including) Decorator design pattern.<br>
Student must prepare 5 min presentation (with slides) which will answer following questions:
  1) What have you created?
  2) Did you have any problems?
  3) Did you learn anything new?
  4) What could be improved?

Student proposes project's topic which must be accepted by teacher.<br><br>
Students from groups **1**, **2**, and **3** will present their projects on **29th May**. Deadline: **2023-05-28 23:59:59** <br>
Students from group **4** will present their projects on **30th May**. Deadline: **2023-05-29 23:59:59**<br><br>
All code and presentation must be committed to your public repository to folder **project** before deadline.
