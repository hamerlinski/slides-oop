# Object Oriented Programming
## How to pass?

* Exercises during classes and work in the classroom + tests/quiz.
* Project.
* Extra points for open source contribution.

Lessons typically will start with topic introduction. Then students will perform small and simple tasks which will be reviewed and graded before end of class. After teacher's approval, students must commit their solution.

$$
\begin{array}{c}

\mathbb{X} = 0.5 \times\mathbb{E} + 0.5 \times\mathbb{P} \\
\tt where\,\, \mathbb{E}\,\, means\,\, average\,\, from\,\, excercies,\\
\tt and\,\, \mathbb{P}\,\, means\,\, grade\,\, from\,\, the\,\, project

\end{array}
$$

<br>

**Each of the components of the grade must be positive.**
