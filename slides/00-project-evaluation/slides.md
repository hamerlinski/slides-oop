# Object Oriented Programming
## How to pass? - Project
Project must obey all rules presented up to (including) Decorator design pattern.<br>
Student must prepare 5 min presentation (with slides) which will answer following questions:
  1) What have you created?
  2) Did you have any problems?
  3) Did you learn anything new?
  4) What could be improved?

Student proposes project's topic which must be accepted by teacher.<br><br>
Students from groups **1**, **2**, and **3** will present their projects on **29th May**. Deadline: **2023-05-28 23:59:59** <br>
Students from group **4** will present their projects on **30th May**. Deadline: **2023-05-29 23:59:59**<br><br>

# Object Oriented Programming
## How to pass?
The point system for grading an object-oriented programming project written in C++ based on the specified requirements:

1. Class and Attribute Design: 20 points
   - Appropriate use of classes to model the problem domain
   - Proper design and implementation of class attributes

2. Method and Object Design: 20 points
   - Proper design and implementation of methods to perform desired functionalities
   - Effective use of objects to represent entities in the problem domain

3. Constructor Implementation: 15 points
   - Correct implementation and usage of constructors for object initialization

4. Interface Design: 15 points
   - Proper definition and implementation of interfaces to enforce contract-based programming

5. Exception Handling: 10 points
   - Appropriate use of exception handling mechanisms to handle errors and exceptional cases

6. Testing: 15 points
   - Comprehensive testing of the implemented functionalities
   - Adequate coverage of edge cases and boundary conditions

7. Decorator Pattern Implementation: 5 points
   - Correct implementation and usage of the Decorator design pattern in the project

8. Commit over time: **minus 10 points**

Total: 100 points

60 - 67%  ➡️ 3.0<br>
68 - 75%  ➡️ 3.5<br>
76 - 83%  ➡️ 4.0<br>
84 - 91%  ➡️ 4.5<br>
92 - 100% ➡️ 5.0<br>

Grading will be based on the fulfillment of each requirement and the quality of implementation. The points can be allocated based on the evaluation of the project's code, design documentation, and the demonstration of functionalities.
