# Open Source Contribution
## What does “open source” mean?
A project is open source if it can be used, studied, modified, and distributed by anybody for any reason. By the use of an open source license, these rules are enforced.

Open source is effective because it decreases adoption and collaboration barriers, enabling users to swiftly propagate and enhance projects. Also, compared to closed source, it allows people the ability to govern their own computers. Instead than solely depending on a closed source vendor's product decisions, a company utilizing open source software, for instance, has the choice to hire someone to create bespoke modifications to the software.

The same group of projects are referred to as free software and open source.
As "free and open source software" (FOSS) or "free, libre, and open source software," these phrases are also occasionally used in combination (FLOSS).
Free and libre are used to describe freedom, not cost.

# Open Source Contribution
## How to contribute?
Take some advice from former U.S. President John F. Kennedy if you've never made an open source contribution before: "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country."

There are many different degrees and types of contributions to open source projects. You don't have to spend too much time worrying about the specifics of your initial submission or how it will happen.

# Open Source Contribution
## How to contribute?
Open source was created by regular people like you; it is not an exclusive club. The word "open source" is just a fancy way of saying that the world's issues can be solved.

If you quickly scan a README, you could spot a typo or a broken link. If you're a new user, you could have found a bug or another issue that you believe belongs in the manual. Check to see whether you can contribute by helping, as opposed to ignoring it and moving on or expecting someone else to repair it. It is the main goal of open source software!

# Open Source Contribution
## How to contribute?
Every open source project has a /contribute page that highlights beginner-friendly issues you can start with if you're looking for existing problems you can repair.

Go to the repository's home page on GitHub and add /contribute to the end of the URL (for instance, https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/contribute). 

It's good idea to search issues with `good first issue` label.
